//The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
//Each object has two properties: year and result
//It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
//It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
//If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined

//returns a year the KC Chiefs won the superbowl
//returns undefined if the record has no win objects
